# Embedded-Digital-Systems--C--Assignment-
Contains a GUI developed using C# default and online user controls which interact with a C Program that works with the AT90USB1287 Micro in AUT's lab room

GUI will not have working functionality since the program is tailored to make use of the peripherals contained on the AUT Labboard in WS412, requires the C program 
to be running at the same time along with a working COM port between the PC and the Labboard.
